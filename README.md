# Simple 2D Raycasting Project

This is a minimal 2D raycasting demo written in Python.  
It demonstrates how a player can cast rays to detect walls and visualize line-of-sight or light behavior in a 2D environment.

## Features
- Basic 2D raycasting logic using geometry and trigonometry
- Movable player with adjustable direction
- Wall collision detection
- Simple grid-based map
- Visual ray lines for each cast

## Requirements
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Pygame library

Install Pygame using:
```bash
pip install pygame
or 
uv add pygame
